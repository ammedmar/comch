    "# The surjection operad\n",

    "In this notebook we describe the $E_\\infty$-operad $\\mathcal X$ known as the surjection operad. It is equipped with a filtration by $E_n$-operads which we also describe. It was introduced in [[McS]](#mcs) and also studied by [[BF]](#bf) with a different sign conventions. We implement both conventions but describe the constructions only up to signs. We will assume familiarity with chain complexes and operads.\n",

    "The complexity of a finite binary sequence (i.e. a sequence of two distinct values) is defined as the number of consecutive distinct elements in it. For example, (1,2,2,1) and (1,1,1,2) have complexities 2 and 1 respectively. The **complexity** of a basis surjection element is defined as the maximum value of the complexities of its binary subsequences. Notice that for arity 2, the complexity of an element agrees with its degree. It is proven in [McCS] that the subcomplex generated by basis surjection elements of complexity at most $n$ define a suboperad of $\\mathcal X$ modeling an $E_{n+1}$-operad.\n",
